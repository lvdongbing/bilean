Before You Start
================

If you would like to contribute to the development of OpenStack,
you must follow the steps in this page:

   http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html

Once those steps have been completed, changes to OpenStack
should be submitted for review via the Gerrit tool, following
the workflow documented at:

   http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html#development-workflow

Reporting Bugs
==============

Pull requests submitted through Github will be ignored.

Bugs should be filed on Launchpad, not Github:

   https://bugs.launchpad.net/bilean

Meet the Developers
===================

Real-time communication among developers are mostly done via IRC.
The team is using the #openstack-bilean channel on freenode.net.
